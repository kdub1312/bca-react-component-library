# React Component Repo
This repo is intended to be used as a submodule of a main project repo. Currently it is included as a submodule of the bedtime-checklist-app repo, which is private.

This way, I can share my component learnings here publicly, while keeping my actual project repo private.

## TODO:
- Currently, this library contains compiled code. This is because the library is a submodule that relies on the main project repos build process. The dev build currently can compile this code at run time. I am working on setting up the production build to do the same, but until I have that completed I am allowing this repo to house the compiled code, for use in production.
